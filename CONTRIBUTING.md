# Contributing

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project!

You can contribute to Huak by checking for unassigned issues on our [issue board](https://github.com/users/cnpryer/projects/5) or even just documenting features and bugs by creating new issues.

## Communication

You can reach out to me on discord at cnpryer#6201 if you have any questions. Otherwise please feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/discussions/new) or [open an issue](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/issues/new/).

## Testing

During the early stages of Huak's development, we'll use `cargo test -- --test-threads=1` to allow manipulation of one `.venv`. An issue to improve on this in the future has been opened at #123.

Since we are using a hacky .venv testing strategy, you'll want to run tests using a `HUAK_MUTE_COMMAND` environment variable.

We set `--test-threads=1` in .cargo/config.toml so we can just run:

```console
$ HUAK_MUTE_COMMAND=True cargo test
```

Note that since we are dedicating a `.venv` to testing Huak, you should expect to have a `.venv` exist in your local project. Huak needs a Python environment (specifically a venv) to run its commands from the context of. #123 will resolve this.

## Making a contribution

We follow the standard [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) when making contributions to Huak.

Please make sure your PR is associated with an issue. Create one [here](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/issues/new).

1. After being assigned to an issue or communicating your interest, fork the repository and get started by creating a new branch for your work.
2. When you're ready to create your PR, feel free to use our PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md to indicate what issue your PR is closing and the changes made to close it.

We also use `pre-commit` to ensure changes will pass CI from our local environments. We recommend using it.

To use `pre-commit` [install it](https://pre-commit.com/#install) and run `pre-commit install` from the project directory's root.

You'll notice the main checks are:

- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo clippy`
- `cargo test`
