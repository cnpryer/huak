# Contributing

We appriciate your interest in contributing to our project!

You can contribute to Huak by checking for unassigned issues on our [issue board](https://github.com/users/cnpryer/projects/5) or even just documenting features and bugs by creating new issues.

## Testing

During the early stages of Huak's development, we'll use `cargo test -- --test-threads=1` to allow manipulation of one .venv. An issue to improve on this in the future has been opened at #123. This is set in .cargo/config.toml as well.

## Making a contribution

We follow the standard [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) when making contributions to Huak.

Please make sure your PR is associated with an issue. Create one [here](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/issues/new).

1. After being assigned to an issue or communicating your interest, fork the repository and get started by creating a new branch for your work.
2. When you're ready to create your PR, feel free to use our PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md to indicate what issue your PR is closing and the changes made to close it.

We also use `pre-commit` to ensure changes will pass CI from our local environments. We recommend using it.

To use `pre-commit` [install it](https://pre-commit.com/#install) and run `pre-commit install` from the project directory's root.

You'll notice the main checks are:

- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo clippy`
- `cargo test`
