//! ## Goals
//!
//! There are a few guiding principles steering the development of Huak:
//!
//! ### 1. Serve as a learning instrument üìö
//!
//! - Python packaging is a very interesting topic right now.
//! - It's challenging and dev tools are some of my favorite products, I'm curious of how they work.
//! - Learn Rust and about building fast, snappy, and opinionated software.
//!
//! ### 2. Just use `huak` ‚ú®
//!
//! I love Rust's onboarding experience. Cargo has played a large role. It's a great tool for newcomers to use to get their feet wet. Huak can provide the same experience for Python.
//!
//! ### 3. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è
//!
//! There's room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. One of the guiding principles will be "Is this the fastest it can be?"
//!
//! ### 4. Python ü§ù Rust
//!
//! JavaScript has seen a "Going Rust" sub-community pop up. Python seems to be getting one too. Huak would be able to fuel contributions to the intersection of these two languages.
