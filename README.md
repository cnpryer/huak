## About

A Python package manager written in Rust. The [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for Python.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: `huak` is in an experimental state.

Huak aims to support a base workflow for developing Python packages and projects. The process is linear and purpose oriented, establishing better familiarization with the steps.

The goal is to create an opinionated tool to support a reliably inviting onboarding experience for the Python ecosystem, that feels responsive and snappy to use.

## Goals

### 1. Just use `huak` ‚ú®

The Rust ecosystem has a fantastic onboarding experience. Cargo plays a large role. Huak can provide the same experience for Python.

### 2. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

There's room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. One of the guiding principles will be *"Is this the fastest it can be?"*

### 3. Python ü§ù Rust

JavaScript has seen a "Going Rust" sub-community pop up. Huak is positioned well to help sustain future development of Rust-based software for the Python ecosystem.
