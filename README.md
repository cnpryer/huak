## About

A Python package manager written in Rust. The [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for Python.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: `huak` is currently in its [proof-of-concept (PoC) phase](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/milestones).

Huak aims to support a base workflow for developing Python packages and projects. The process is linear and purpose oriented, establishing better familiarization with the steps.

```

See the [design doc](/docs/design_doc.md) for more workflow details.

The goal is to create an opinionated tool to support a reliably inviting onboarding experience for the Python ecosystem, that feels responsive and snappy to use.

## Installation

A PoC and an 0.1.0 are expected.

During the [PoC phase](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/milestones) you'll need to explicitly install the latest pre-release available.

`‚ùØ cargo install huak --version` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/huak.svg?label="")](https://crates.io/crates/huak)


Around 0.1.0 you'll be able to install `huak` using `brew` or `pip`. Distribution plans will be finalized closer to 0.1.0.

## Documentation

If you've cloned the repository, run `cargo doc --open`.

Some documentation for 0.0.x releases will land on docs.rs. Around the 0.1.0 release I'd like to have more robust documentation about Huak for users, contributors, and the curious.

## Goals

Besides some of my own experience with the Python ecosystem, there are a few additional guiding principles steering the development of Huak:

### 1. Open to open source üìö

Open source has done a lot for me both from a tooling and professional development perspective. I'd love to offer Huak as a way to help onboard the absolute and relative newcomers (like myself).

### 2. Just use `huak` ‚ú®

I love Rust's onboarding experience. Cargo has played a large role. It's a great tool for newcomers to use to get their feet wet. Huak can provide the same experience for Python.

### 3. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

There's room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. One of the guiding principles will be "Is this the fastest it can be?"

### 4. Python ü§ù Rust

JavaScript has seen a "Going Rust" sub-community pop up. Python seems to be getting one too. Huak would be able to fuel contributions to the intersection of these two languages.
