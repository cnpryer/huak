A Python package manager written in Rust. The [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for Python.

See either [this milestone list](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/milestones) or [the issue board](https://github.com/users/cnpryer/projects/5) to check the status of this project at any point in time.

## Goals

There are a few guiding principles steering the development of Huak:

### 1. Serve as a learning instrument üìö

- Python packaging is a very interesting topic right now.
- It's challenging and dev tools are some of my favorite products, I'm curious of how they work.
- Learn Rust and about building fast, snappy, and opinionated software.

### 2. All-in-one ‚ú®

I love Rust's onboarding experience. Cargo has played a large role. It's a great tool for newcomers use to get their feet wet. Huak can provide the same experience for Python.

### 3. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

There's room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. One of the guiding principles will be "Is this the fastest it can be?"

### 4. Python ü§ù Rust

JavaScript has seen a "Going Rust" sub-community pop up. Python seems to be getting one too. I'd love for Huak to help build interest in the cross-section of these two languages.
