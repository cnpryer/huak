## Goals

Besides some of my own experience with the Python ecosystem, there are a few additional guiding principles steering the development of Huak:

### 1. Open to open source üìö

Open source has done a lot for me both from a tooling and professional development perspective. I'd love to offer Huak as a way to help onboard the absolute and relative newcomers (like myself).

### 2. Just use `huak` ‚ú®

I love Rust's onboarding experience. Cargo has played a large role. It's a great tool for newcomers to use to get their feet wet. Huak can provide the same experience for Python.

### 3. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

There's room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. One of the guiding principles will be "Is this the fastest it can be?"

### 4. Python ü§ù Rust

JavaScript has seen a "Going Rust" sub-community pop up. Python seems to be getting one too. Huak would be able to fuel contributions to the intersection of these two languages.
