## About

A Python package manager written in Rust. The [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for Python.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: `huak` is in an experimental state.

Huak aims to support a base workflow for developing Python packages and projects. The process is linear and purpose oriented, establishing better familiarization with the steps.

```

See the [design doc](/docs/design_doc.md) for more workflow details.

The goal is to create an opinionated tool to support a reliably inviting onboarding experience for the Python ecosystem, that feels responsive and snappy to use.

## Documentation

More documentation can be found [here](./docs/user_guide.md).

## Goals

### 1. Just use `huak` ‚ú®

The Rust ecosystem has a fantastic onboarding experience. Cargo plays a large role. Huak can provide the same experience for Python.

### 2. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

There's room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. One of the guiding principles will be *"Is this the fastest it can be?"*.

### 3. Python ü§ù Rust

JavaScript has seen a "Going Rust" sub-community pop up. Huak is positioned well to help sustain future development of Rust-based software for the Python ecosystem.
