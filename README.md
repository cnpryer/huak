## About

A Python package manager written in Rust. The [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for Python.

Huak aims to be a snappy package manager for Python, supporting a standard base workflow with bootstrapping, configuration, dependency management, testing, building, and distribution tools. This package manager can be used for Python packages and projects.

The goal is to create an opinionated tool to support an inviting onboarding experience to projects and the Python space, that's also responsive and snappy to use.

## Installation

A PoC and an 0.1.0 are expected.

During the [PoC phase](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/milestones) you'll need to explicitly install the latest pre-release available.

```
‚ùØ cargo install --version 0.0.3-alpha.1
```

Around 0.1.0 you'll be able to install `huak` using `brew` or `pip`. Distribution plans will be finalized closer to 0.1.0.

```

## Documentation

If you've cloned the repository, run `cargo doc --open`.

Some documentation for 0.0.x releases will land on docs.rs. Around the 0.1.0 release I'd like to have more robust documentation about Huak for users, contributors, and the curious.

## Goals

Besides some of my own experience with the Python ecosystem, there are a few additional guiding principles steering the development of Huak:

### 1. Open to open source üìö

Open source has done a lot for me both from a tooling and professional development perspective. I'd love to offer Huak as a way to help onboard the absolute and relative newcomers (like myself).

### 2. Just use `huak` ‚ú®

I love Rust's onboarding experience. Cargo has played a large role. It's a great tool for newcomers to use to get their feet wet. Huak can provide the same experience for Python.

### 3. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

There's room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. One of the guiding principles will be "Is this the fastest it can be?"

### 4. Python ü§ù Rust

JavaScript has seen a "Going Rust" sub-community pop up. Python seems to be getting one too. Huak would be able to fuel contributions to the intersection of these two languages.
