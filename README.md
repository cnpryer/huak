A Python package manager written in Rust. The [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for Python.

See either [this milestone list](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak/milestones) or [the issue board](https://github.com/users/cnpryer/projects/5) to check the status of this project at any point in time.

## Goals

There are a few guiding principles steering the development of Huak:

### 1. Serve as a learning instrument üìö

This project is meant to invite curiosity and remain friendly to Rust or open source newcomers. I'd like to learn to use Rust and how package managers work, so it's a nice blend for a project.

### 2. All-in-one ‚ú®

My goal is to build a package manager to standardize Python dev-tooling for common developer needs. Similar to Cargo, I'd love to build a package manager that invites Python newcomers and centralizes a lot of its dev-tooling for an enjoyable onboarding experience.

### 3. Fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

I believe there's tons of room for faster tooling in the Python ecosystem. I'm a fan of snappy, responsive software, so one of the guiding principles will be "Is this the fastest it can be?"

### 4. Contribute to Python and Rust interop ‚òØ

As with the JavaScript ecosystem, I think Rust has a lot of potential in the Python space. One key ingredient will be sustainability and the community's role. Through Huak I hope to support this emerging community in order to help boost long-term sustainability.
